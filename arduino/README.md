# ARDUINO TEMPLATE

## What is it?

How to build and upload code to an Arduino from a Linux OS.

## Credit/Disclaimer

I did not create this method of build and uploading code to an Arduino. A user
called *ladislas*[https://github.com/ladislas/bare-arduino-project] did that. I
simply cloned his project, removed files pertaining to Mac/Windows OS, and
trimmed it down solely for a Linux OS. I will be working exclusively on a Linux
OS, so for my future projects, I will be copying this template. I realize that
the directory structure of *ladislas'* template is such that you can have other
projects within it, so that I can have each Arduino project be its own entity, I
will copy this template for each future project.
